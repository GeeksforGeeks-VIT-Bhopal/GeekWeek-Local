We live in a tech-savvy world which is connected very vastly with large number of networks sometimes also referred to as a “web”. To connect, each other living in various parts of the world “connection” plays a very important role. We cannot imagine ourselves without connections be it in LinkedIn (we all know) or in general as a whole. Even if our phone network goes down for a while, we all start cursing the network provider and definitely a thought of “changing the network provider” comes in all of our minds. 
Every Telecom company tries to launch fast networks in market one such network is 5G which will very soon bang on Indian Markets by telecom giants like Airtel and Jio.
A question definitely comes in all of our minds that- “what is there in 5G which is not in 4G and why one must switch to 5G”- well, there are varied answers for this question. 5G provides us a better bandwidth because of which our network connection becomes strong and fast. It also provides platform-centric services. It leads us to enhanced connectivity which is very helpful for businesses and individual benefit.
5G will bring every “buzzword” like AI, IoT concepts possible and strong because with better connectivity comes better speed and better technologies like automation of various services just at the tip of our hands.
