I'm Aashay. This is probably my first time creating a repo like this that doesn't really have a code. So, first time for everything I guess.
I was born in the city my mum grew up in and was raised in the city my mum was born in. We have that vice-versa relation going on, which is a lesser known fact about me. It's random, sure. But, still interesting.
I've got a scar on my foreead, that makes me feel like Harry Potter but the story behind it is really silly because I really just fell on my head and injured myself. 
To finish it up, I recently applied for driving licenses and gave the tests. I passed in them. But I have very little to no intention of actually owning a vehicle and driving it because I hate the roads here.
Right, so that's about it for this task. Phew.
